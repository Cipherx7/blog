## Definition

- Threat intelligence is **data that is collected, processed, and analyzed to understand a threat actor’s motives, targets, and attack behaviors**. Threat intelligence enables us to make faster, more informed, data-backed security decisions and change their behavior from reactive to proactive in the fight against [threat actors](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/threat-actor/).
- Threat intelligence refers to information that organizations can use to combat cyber threats. This information starts off as vast sets of unorganized data that cybersecurity professionals and data scientists explore, visualize, and analyze, aided by ML platforms and libraries, in order to transform this data into actionable insights that power informed decisions.
